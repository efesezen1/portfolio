  <p>
    I'm a software engineer with a passion for building cool stuff. I'm
    currently working at <a href="https://www.ayova.co/en">Ayova</a>, where I
    get to work on interesting problems with a great team. I'm also a bit of a
    gamer, and I love building side projects in my free time. I'm always looking
    to learn new things and improve my skills, so if you have any ideas or
    suggestions, I'd love to hear them!
